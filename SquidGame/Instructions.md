# Welcome to the SSSC's Squid Games!

Congratulations! You are the mastermind behind the Squid Games! Now, you have the opportunity to provide players with a huge financial advantage or lead them straight to their deaths! 

## Challenge Objective

For this challenge, you will implement some Java classes to create a simulation of the marbles game from the Squid Games show. 


## Game Rules

This is a 2 player game consisting of you, one other person and 10 marbles each, the goal is to take all the other players' marbles:


If you haven't watched squid games (Highly suggested watch), HERE ARE THE RULES OF THE GAME:

    Note: The first player is decided randomly.

1. `Player1` grabs any number of marbles from their bag (do not show this amount to the other player).
2. `Player2` grabs any number of marbles from their bag (this amount is what player2 is willing to bet to get from player1).
3. `Player2` will now try to guess whether the Player1 has an even or odd amount of marbles in their hands.
4. If `Player2` guesses correctly, they take however many marbles they wagered from `Player1`. If `Player2` guesses incorrectly, they give all the marbles they wagered to `Player1`.
5. Switch roles, now `Player1` guesses.



## Details
There are three classes in the `SquidGames` directory:

- Game.java
- Marbles.java
- Player.java

Try to achieve the objective by using these three classes. Remember that the rules of the game must be respected!


Make sure that your program follows these considerations:
1. One of two players is picked randomly to have the first turn.
2. Be careful with limits. Each player should have an amount of marbles between 0 and 20.
